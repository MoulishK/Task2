OBJECTS AND IT’S INTERNAL REPRESENTATION


OBJECT
=> Objects are fundamental data type in javascript, that allows to store and organize data in key value pairs.
=> Object is a complex data type that can represent real word entity and is used for efficient data manipulation and structuring.
=> Unlike primitive data type in javascript objects are more complex and can contain a combination of primitive data type and reference data type.
=> An object is a reference data type, meaning that variables assigned an object value store a reference or pointer to the object’s location in memory.
Object consist of priority and methods.

PRIORITY :
Priorities are variables attached to objects, defining it’s  characteristics.
They are accessed using dot (.) notation.  


METHODS: 
Methods are function associated with the objects.
For example, if a object represents a student, then it might have properties like name, roll number, age address, as well as methods like updated address, and updated name.

PROTOTYPES AND INHERITANCE:
Javascript is a prototype based language, and objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects through their data prototype.This mechanism enables the creation of hierarchical structure.
Understanding how objects work and their internal representation empowers to write expressive and modular code.
